      <p>My name is Rishi Nitin Agrawal.</p>
      <p>
        I began playing chess in 9th grade, when a chess craze swept across high
        school. I never quite understood how to solve a Rubiks's Cube and didn't
        care for Beyblades, so I sat those two waves out. But I fell in love
        with chess, and I've been playing it (off and on) ever since. I was even
        Head Arbiter for a school tournament we organized!
      </p>
      <p>
        I might have been inspired by one of my best friends. We used to visit
        each others' houses to just play chess. I still remember the one time I
        let him rampage across my side of the board while I set up a sneaky
        attack and won.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never quite good but forever enamoured by the beauty of chess, I created
        this website in July 2025 as a quiet place to reflect on this game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have endeavored to make this website a small labor of love. I have
        written it entirely by hand, populated it with quotes that have
        personally inspired me, and built it with nothing but raw HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript without any frameworks without any frameworks whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website was directly and heavily inspired by
        <a href="://musicthoughts.com/">musicthoughts.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like it, this website will remain a totally free,
        <a href="https://github.com/banflam/ch-thoughts">open</a>,
        non-commercial website, here only as inspiration and to ponder the
        beauty of chess
